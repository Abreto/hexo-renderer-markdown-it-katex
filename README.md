# hexo-renderer-markdown-it

Add support for [Markdown] and [CommonMark]. This plugin uses [Markdown-it] as a render engine on [Hexo].

## Installation

``` bash
$ npm install hexo-renderer-markdown-it --save
```

## Options

Markdown-it offers powerful customization. Sadly, it's not implemented in this plugin as of now, although I'm making this my top priority.

[Markdown]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/
[Markdown-it]: https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it
